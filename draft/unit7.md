    1. Develop greedy algorithms for optimization problems, such as the fractional knapsack problem and activity selection.
    2. Examine the principles and applications of randomised algorithms in problem-solving.

> Greedy algorithms are a fundamental class of algorithms that **build up a solution piece by piece**, always choosing the next piece that offers the **most immediate benefit (the locally optimal choice)**. They are widely used for optimization problems where local choices can lead to a globally optimal solution.

## 7.1 Fundamental of Greedy Algorithm

### 7.1.1 Characteristics of greedy algorithms

Greedy algorithms follow a specific pattern in their design and implementation. The main characteristics include:

1. **Local Optimization:** At each step, the algorithm makes the choice that seems best at that moment (locally optimal decision).
2. **Irrevocability**: Once a choice is made, it cannot be changed later (no backtracking).
3. **Feasibility:** Each chosen step must lead to a valid intermediate solution (should not violate problem constraints).
4. **Greedy Criteria:** The algorithm selects the element with the maximum or minimum value according to a specific criterion.
5. **Iterative Construction:** The solution is built incrementally, step by step, until a complete solution is formed.
