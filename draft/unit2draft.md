## 2.2 Model of Computation (Word-RAM)

### 2.2.1 Basic Operations and Their Time Complexity

- Arithmetic (+, -, \*, /), comparisons, and assignments assumed **O(1)**.
- Array access and pointer dereferencing also **O(1)**.

### 2.2.2 Memory Model and Addressing

- Memory is modeled as an array of words (fixed size).
- Each word can be accessed in constant time.
- Suitable for analyzing most modern computers.

### 2.2.3 Comparison with Other Computation Models

- **Turing Machine:** Theoretical, less practical for real hardware analysis.
- **PRAM (Parallel RAM):** Models parallel computing.
- **Word-RAM:** Balances practicality and simplicity.

## 2.5 O-notation, Ω-notation, and Θ-notation

### 2.5.1 O-notation (Upper Bound)

- Describes the **worst-case upper limit** on growth rate.
- Example: f(n) = 3n² + 2n + 1 ∈ O(n²).

### 2.5.2 Ω-notation (Lower Bound)

- Describes the **minimum growth rate** of an algorithm.
- Example: f(n) = 3n² + 2n + 1 ∈ Ω(n²).

### 2.5.3 Θ-notation (Tight Bound)

- When both upper and lower bounds are the same.
- Example: f(n) = 3n² + 2n + 1 ∈ Θ(n²).

### 2.5.4 Relationships Between Notations

- If f(n) ∈ Θ(g(n)), then f(n) ∈ O(g(n)) and f(n) ∈ Ω(g(n)).

## 2.6 Standard Notation & Common Functions

### 2.6.1 Polynomial Functions and Their Growth Rates

- n, n², n³ … grow faster as degree increases.
- Example: n³ grows faster than n².

### 2.6.2 Logarithmic and Exponential Functions

- log n grows very slowly, exponential (2ⁿ) grows very fast.
- Example: log₂(1024) = 10, but 2¹⁰ = 1024.

### 2.6.3 Floor and Ceiling Functions

- Floor ⌊x⌋: Largest integer ≤ x.
- Ceiling ⌈x⌉: Smallest integer ≥ x.

### 2.6.4 Factorial and Combinatorial Functions

- n! = n × (n-1) × … × 1 (grows extremely fast).
- Useful in probability, combinatorics, and complexity analysis.
