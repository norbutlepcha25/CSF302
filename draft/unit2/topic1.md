# 2.1 Asymptotic Analysis

Algorithms are a set of finite rules or instructions to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations

2.1.1 Features of Algorithm

Every algorithm must satisfy the following Criteria:

1. **Input:** there are zero or more quantities, which are externally supplied;

2. **Output:** at least one quantity is produced;

3. **Definiteness:** each instruction must be clear and unambiguous;

4. **Finiteness** if we trace out the instructions of an algorithm, then for all cases the algorithm will terminate after a finite number of steps;

5. **Effectiveness:** every instruction must be sufficiently basic that it can in
   principle be carried out by a person using only pencil and paper. It is not enough that each operation be definite, but it must also be feasible.

## 2.1.1 Concept of growth rates

- Asymptotic Analysis : Asymptotic analysis of an algorithm studies its efficiency in terms of **input size n** as n→∞. It provides an estimate of time or space complexity using notations bigO. Theta , omega and is independent of hardware or implementation.
