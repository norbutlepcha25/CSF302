# Integer Multiplication

Integer multiplication is one of the fundamental operations in computer science and mathematics. While multiplying small numbers is not complex, multiplying large integers efficiently is critical in applications such as:

1. Cryptography (RSA, ECC, etc.) : modern cryptography, require manipulation of integers that are over 100 decimal digits long.

2. Computer Algebra Systems

3. High-precision scientific computing

4. Complexity theory and algorithm research

### 4.3.1 Naive Approch to Integer multiplication

The Naive approch of integer multiplication involves multiplying digit by digit, carrying over and adding partial products to arrive at the final answer. If the two numbers have `n` digits each, you perform `n * n` single-digit multiplications.

Example: $456 \times 123 $

Solution : $(456 \times 1)+(456 \times 2)+(456 \times 3) = 56,088$

Example 2:

Multiply 123 × 45 (in base 10):

- 123 × 5 = 615
- 123 × 40 = 4920
- Sum = 5535

This corresponds to digit-by-digit partial products and shifts.

Time complexity = $O(n^2)$

**_Pseudocode_**

```
function naiveMultiply(A[0..n-1], B[0..n-1]):  // digits little-endian (least significant first)
    // result array length up to 2n
    R = array of zeros length 2n
    for i from 0 to n-1:
        carry = 0
        for j from 0 to n-1:
            temp = R[i + j] + A[i] * B[j] + carry
            R[i + j] = temp mod BASE
            carry = floor(temp / BASE)
        R[i + n] += carry
    return normalize(R)  // remove leading zeros
```

### 4.3.2 Karatsuba Algorithm for integer multiplication

Karatsuba’s algorithm reduces the number of multiplications by using divide and conquer. Split each `n`-digit number into two halves (high and low):

Let $m = floor(\frac{n}{2})$. Write

$ X = X_1 \times 10^m + X_0 $

$Y = Y_1 \times 10^m + Y_0$

The straightforward expansion gives four products:

$$
\boxed{X \times Y = (X_1 \cdot Y_1) \cdot 10^{2m} + (X_1 \cdot Y_0 + X_0 \cdot Y_1) \cdot 10^m + X_0 \cdot Y_0}
$$

Naively, that needs 4 multiplications of size \~n/2. Karatsuba avoids computing $X_1*Y_0$ and $X_0*Y_1$ separately by computing:

\[
\begin{align*}
P_1 &= X_1 \cdot Y_1 \\
P_2 &= X_0 \cdot Y_0 \\
P_3 &= (X_1 + X_0)(Y_1 + Y_0) - P_1 - P_2 \quad \text{(equals $X_1Y_0 + X_0Y_1$)} \\
\end{align*}
\]

$$\boxed{X \cdot Y = P_1 \cdot 10^{2m} + P_3\cdot 10^m + P_2}$$

Thus only **3** multiplications of half-size numbers are needed.

```
function karatsubaMultiply(X, Y):
    m = floor(n / 2)
    X1, X0 = split(X, m)
    Y1, Y0 = split(Y, m)

    P1 = karatsubaMultiply(X1, Y1)
    P2 = karatsubaMultiply(X0, Y0)
    P3 = karatsubaMultiply(X1 + X0, Y1 + Y0)

    cross = P3 - P1 - P2
    return P1 * 10^(2m) + cross * 10^m + P2
```

Example:
Multiply $X = 1234$, $Y = 5678$ in base 10:

1.  Split with $m = 2$ (two-digit halves):

    - $X_1 = 12$, $X_0 = 34$ ; $Y_1 = 56$, $Y_0 = 78$

2.  Compute three products (recursively or directly):

    - $P_1 = 12 * 56 = 672$
    - $P_2 = 34 * 78 = 2652$
    - $P_3 = (12 + 34) * (56 + 78) = 46 * 134 = 6164$

3.  $cross = P_3 - P_1 - P_2 = 6164 - 672 - 2652 = 2840$
4.  Recombine:

    - $P_1 * 10^{2m} = 672 * 10^4 = 6,720,000$
    - $cross * 10^m = 2840 * 10^2 = 284,000$
    - $P_2 = 2,652$
    - Sum = $6,720,000 + 284,000 + 2,652 = 7,006,652$

Check: $1234 * 5678 = 7,006,652$

Karatsuba recurrence:

$$
T(n) = 3 T(n/2) + O(n)
$$

Apply the Master Theorem :

- $a = 3$, $b = 2$ → exponent $log_b(a) = log_2 3  ≈ 1.585$.
- Therefore: $T(n) = Θ(n^{log_2 3}) ≈ Θ(n^{1.585})$.

This is asymptotically faster than $Θ(n^2)$ for large $n$.

**Comparison & When to Use Which **

| Aspect                    |         Naïve (schoolbook) |                                           Karatsuba |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------: | --------------------------------------------------: |
| Asymptotic time           |                   $Θ(n^2)$ |                     $Θ(n^{log_2 3}) ≈ Θ(n^{1.585})$ |
| Best for                  | Small to moderate integers |                                      Large integers |
| Implementation complexity |                     Simple | Moderate (careful splitting, carries, thresholding) |

**Rule of thumb:** For very large integers (hundreds to thousands of machine-word limbs), Karatsuba gives measurable speedups. For small sizes, the simple naive algorithm is often faster.
